# Overview

ManufacTMS is a comprehensive Training Management System designed specifically for manufacturing environments. The application provides compliance training management, certification tracking, audit requirement management, and regulatory compliance reporting. It features a modern web interface built with React and TypeScript, backed by a Node.js/Express server with PostgreSQL database storage.

# Recent Changes (September 30, 2025)

## Role-Aware Training Approval Workflows
- **Submission Source Tracking**: Added `submissionSource` field to training_needs table (EMPLOYEE or MANAGER)
  - Automatically set based on requester's role when creating training needs
  - Manager-initiated requests require single-stage HR approval only
  - Employee-initiated requests use two-stage approval (Manager → HR)
- **Approval Flow Logic**: Backend enforces different approval paths based on submissionSource
  - Managers cannot approve their own submissions
  - HR can approve both manager-initiated and employee-initiated needs
- **UI Adaptation**: Training Needs page dynamically shows/hides approval buttons based on user role and submission source

## Nomination Seat Capacity Checking
- **Capacity Enforcement**: POST /api/nominations validates maxParticipants before creating nominations
  - Counts existing enrollments + approved/pending nominations
  - Returns "Seat is full, please contact HR" message when capacity reached
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications automatically display capacity errors to users

## Schema Adjustments
- **Title Field**: Made nullable (not required in form, skill name serves as identifier)
- **Type Field**: Defaults to 'ANY' in backend when not provided by form
- **Status Queries**: Backend supports comma-separated status values for HR admin views (e.g., "MGR_APPROVED,SUBMITTED")

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
